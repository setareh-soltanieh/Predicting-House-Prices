In this project, our aim is to predict house prices based on their given atributes using a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) Network. 
In the data_description.txt file, different atributes of a house is defined. 
In the house price.csv file, each house price with their following atribute is given. 
In order to find the best MLP model, we change some of the parameters such as: 
1. Number of layers
2. Number of each layers' neuron
